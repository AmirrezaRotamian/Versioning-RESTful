# Versioning RESTful APIs with Spring Boot


API versioning is a crucial aspect of software development, especially when it comes to maintaining and extending an existing codebase. By implementing versioning, you can introduce new features without breaking the existing functionality. In this guide, we will walk you through how to implement API versioning in a Spring Boot application using URL versioning. We will create two versions of a simple Task API, allowing you to extend the features while minimizing the impact on existing logic.

### Benefits of API Versioning
API versioning is a fundamental practice in software development, especially in a world where applications are constantly evolving. It offers several key benefits:
* **Backward Compatibility:** By versioning your APIs, you ensure that existing clients and systems continue to function as expected. This means you can introduce new features or make changes without disrupting the users of the previous version.
* **Smoother Transition:** Versioning allows for a gradual and controlled transition between versions. It gives developers the flexibility to update their systems at their own pace, reducing the risk of abrupt and potentially disruptive changes.
* **Clear Documentation:** API versioning provides a clear way to document and communicate changes. Clients can refer to specific versions of the API to understand what is supported and what might have changed.
* **Improved Testing:** Separate versions of the API make testing and quality assurance more manageable. It allows for focused testing on the changes specific to a particular version, reducing the risk of regressions.
* **Future-Proofing:** Versioning enables you to plan for the future. You can design your API with the knowledge that it will evolve, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements and customer feedback.
